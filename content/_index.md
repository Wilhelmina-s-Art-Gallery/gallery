A love for art, a dynamic mentor in Alex Reding of the Nosbaum Reding gallery in Luxembourg and a fortunate encounter with the owners of the Mandraki Beach Resort on Hydra gave Wilhelmina von Blumenthal the impulse she needed to kickstart her own gallery. Wilhelmina’s Art Gallery (WAG’s) opens this summer with the Mandraki Art Project minutes away from the DESTE Project Space Slaughterhouse.
